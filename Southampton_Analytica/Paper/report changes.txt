Hi Chris, in response to your feedback request on the report: 

Possible errors:
 
- "used by business to evaluate" : Application - para 5 - done
- "an deeper" : Introduction - para 1  - done 
- "To build the build" : Machine Learning - para 1  -done 
- "shown to be work well" : Machine Learning - para 1 - done
- "Fairoux" - Header 

Possible changes: 

- Preprocessing para 4 feels a bit lengthy and could be split on "The problem arises"  - done
- Large gap betweeen para 1 and para 2 in Application.  - Latex makes best use of the space, its best to leave 
- We're still mentioning Toronto as well as Las Vegas in the business.  - done 
- Although findings are listed above in Analysis, The conclusion could include a summary 
  of notable results. - Done done and done :) 

Thats all we could find/think of :) your call if you want to change them. 

-Jak.

Thanks Jak, Chris
